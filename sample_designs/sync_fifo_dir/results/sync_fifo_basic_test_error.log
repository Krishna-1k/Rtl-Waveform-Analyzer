 Based on the provided specifications and violation descriptions, here are three possible reasons for the observed read data mismatches in order of highest to lowest confidence:

1. **Buffer Underrun or Overread**: The FIFO may be experiencing either an underrun (not enough data available for reading) or an overread (reading beyond the depth limit). This could happen if the write pointer and read pointer get out of sync, causing the FIFO to read data that has not been written yet or has already been overwritten. This issue can be caused by improper handling of the write enable (wr_en) or read enable (rd_en) signals, or a clock-related problem affecting the timing of write and read operations.

2. **Clock Skew or Timing Violation**: The observed violations suggest that the read operation might be happening before the corresponding write operation has been completed, leading to incorrect data being read. This could be due to clock skew between different parts of the design, which can lead to one part operating at a slightly different rate than another. Another possibility is a setup or hold time violation, where the data is not stable enough during the read clock cycle.

3. **Logic Error**: There might be an underlying logic error in the FIFO's design, such as a incorrect implementation of the circular buffer semantics or improper handling of the DATA_WIDTH. This could cause unexpected behavior that leads to incorrect data being written or read. While less likely, this should still be considered as a potential cause for the observed violations.

To further investigate these issues, you may want to focus on the timing and control signals (clk, rst_n, wr_en, rd_en) in the waveform data and ensure that they are behaving as expected according to the design specifications. Additionally, it would be beneficial to perform a thorough verification of the FIFO's logic, especially focusing on its full and empty detection and the write/read pointer handling.
